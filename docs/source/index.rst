Welcome to Nii-C's documentation!
===================================

**Nii-C** (/ni:k/) is a high-performance, general-purpose Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) library written in modern C, designed for efficient Bayesian inference across diverse scientific domains.


To date, we have used Nii-C to develop several applications for parameter fitting in exoplanet science, spanning astrometric signals, radial velocity curves, transit timing variation (TTV), spectral energy distribution (SED), and thermal emission spectroscopy.
Each application achieves state-of-the-art convergence speed and computational efficiency.


Although Nii-C has so far been demonstrated only in exoplanet science, it is equally capable of addressing high-dimensional sampling challenges in other fields.
If you're beginning to use Nii-C for your own application or have any questions, please feel free to contact us.
